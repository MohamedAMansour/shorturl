Project requirements: (test coverage for the service layer 85%)

1- MongoDB.
2- Local docker deamon.

Configuring mongoDB connection:
======================================
in ShorturlApplication the connection url is hard coded to         
ConnectionString connectionString = new ConnectionString("mongodb://192.168.1.5:27017/shorturl");
in case of local MongoDB , and running the app locally (not as a docker image) , change the connection string to 
ConnectionString connectionString = new ConnectionString("mongodb://localhost:27017/shorturl");
in case running the application within docker , you will need to set the above url to correct local interface (make sure mongodb is bind to the correct IP).


to run the application , not dockerized 
    1) clone the repo
    2) mvn clean package
    2) java -jar target/shorturl-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    
to run dockerized version , change the connection url in the ShorturlApplication to the proper mongodb IP address.


====================================================================================================================================
for running the application using curl:
1- Creating a new shorturl for investing.com
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/shorturls   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   --data-binary "@./src/main/resources/shorturl.json"

where the content of the shorturl.json (sample shorturl.json is included with the project source)
{
  "targetUrl" : "http://investing.com",
  "statsOn" : true
}

response will be:
{
  "shortcutEntry": {
    "id": "6107a207b153d01b48b19aa2",
    "url": "eoHAux",      =====> auto generated short url 
    "destinationUrl": "http://investing.com",
    "nofTimesAccessed": 1
  },
  "errorCode": "4001"   ======> if error code is set to 4001 , that means there is already a shorturl created previously for the url.
}

in that case a collection called shortcutEntry will be created in the mongodb database named "shorturl"
{
	"_id" : ObjectId("6107a166b153d01b48b19aa1"),
	"url" : "eoHArs",                           ===> shortcut name , will be accessed by http://localhost:8080/eoHArs
	"destinationUrl" : "http://investing.com",
	"nOfTimesAccessed" : NumberLong(0),         ===> this field will be increamented each time a user access the short cut
	"_class" : "com.ir.shorturl.domain.ShortcutEntry"
}

2- run the browser with this url http://localhost:8080/eoHArs and you will be directed to investing.com and the below collection will be updated
{
	"_id" : ObjectId("6107a166b153d01b48b19aa1"),
	"url" : "eoHArs",
	"destinationUrl" : "http://investing.com",
	"nOfTimesAccessed" : NumberLong(1),               ========>increamented by 1 cause of the access that happened
	"_class" : "com.ir.shorturl.domain.ShortcutEntry"
}
and other collection entry is created per user ip address:

{
	"_id" : ObjectId("6107a18d1f64941bb1a454b7"),
	"clientIP" : "172.17.0.1",      =============> client ip address
	"url" : "eoHArs",               ============>  shorturl 
	"nOfHists" : NumberLong(2)      ============>  accessed 2 times by that client
}

3- for getting all configured shorturls , run get against this url curl http://localhost:8080/urlstatistics 
[
  {
    "id": "6107a0bb090cbb10c157d409",
    "url": "eoHAod",
    "destinationUrl": "https://google",
    "nofTimesAccessed": 0
  },
  {
    "id": "6107a166b153d01b48b19aa1",
    "url": "eoHArs",
    "destinationUrl": "http://investing.com",
    "nofTimesAccessed": 2
  },
  {
    "id": "6107a207b153d01b48b19aa2",
    "url": "eoHAux",
    "destinationUrl": "http://msn.com",
    "nofTimesAccessed": 1
  }
]

4- for getting user statistics.
curl http://localhost:8080/clienstatistics
  {
    "id": "6107a18d1f64941bb1a454b7",
    "clientIP": "172.17.0.1",
    "url": "eoHArs",
    "nofHists": 2
  },
  {
    "id": "6107a21a1f64941bb1a454f5",
    "clientIP": "172.17.0.1",
    "url": "eoHAux",
    "nofHists": 1
  }

5- In case of wrong/unconfigured url , you will recieve an HTML error page as below 
curl http://localhost:8080/9090

<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head> 
    <title>WHO! short url utility </title> 
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
